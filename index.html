          <p>Hello! My name is Gabriel Dubiela. I was born in the vibrant city of Curitiba, Brazil. I spent a significant portion of my life in the charming city of Santa Maria, Brazil. Now, I'm enjoying the coastal lifestyle in the beautiful city of Santos, Brazil. I'm thirty years old. I have a sister who is four years older than me. I'm blessed to be a husband and a father of two amazing boys. My eldest son, Miguel, is a curious and energetic three-year-old who brings joy to our lives every day. Our youngest, Luca, is a sweet and cuddly five-month-old who fills our home with laughter and love. From 2013 to 2015, I had the privilege of serving a mission in Teresina, Brazil. Currently, I'm serving as a Bishop in my ward for one year. Professionally, I'm a lawyer specializing in public purchases and contracts. I recently embarked on a bachelor's degree in programming at BYU-Idaho through Pathway. I'm excited about the opportunities this new path will open up for me. I  enjoy going to the beach with my family and watching movies and series.</p>
